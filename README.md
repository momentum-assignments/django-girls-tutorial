# Django Girls Tutorial

The Django Girls organization offers an awesome walkthrough of creating a simplified Django app. We'll use this to get the hang of how Django is put together and what it does.

**Please read these instructions before you start.**

1. [Start here at the Introduction](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
2. SKIP the _Installation_ sections
3. READ the section on _How the Internet Works_
4. SKIP _Introduction to the Command Line_ (unless you want a review)
5. SKIP _Python installation_, _Code editor_, and _Introduction to Python_
6. READ _What is Django?_
7. READ _Django installation_: you can skip these steps and install Django the way you saw in class. OR you can install it this way. Entirely up to you.

    (If you do it the way we do in class, you will use `pipenv` instead of `virtualenv` and `pipenv install` instead of `pip install`.)

8. SKIP the _Deploy!_ section. This uses a service called PythonAnywhere to deploy your code. We'll learn about deploying later in the course. You also do not need to do any of the Git steps in this section. Just do your usual routine of adding, committing, and pushing code to _this_ repo.
